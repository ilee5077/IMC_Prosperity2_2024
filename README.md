# IMC Prosperity 2
this year was my first time participating in the trading challenge, Prosperity 2 hosted by IMC trading.

Prosperity 2 is a worldwide trading competition held for 15 days long (although there were some extensions and ended up being 17 days), with 5 rounds of 3 days. each round, the participant works on their trading algorithm to trade new product(s) that are introduced every round and submits answers to a manual trading problem.

I participated as a solo team, and although this was my first dive into trading, I finished 199 out of 10000 teams. (team name: Koreant)

## Reflection
fun 15 days thinking and learning about trading strategies for given product. manual trading challenges also fun. round 2 is still painful, could have finished in top 25. if I didnt get distracted by false signals and had proper methodical way of testing. wish I had found the online open source tool
